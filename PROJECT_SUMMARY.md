# DitheraAI Pro - Project Summary & Game Plan

**Created:** November 11, 2025  
**Your Role:** Solo Developer & Designer  
**Goal:** Build a $10K+/month Photoshop plugin in 6 months

---

## 🎬 The Big Picture

You're building a **premium dithering plugin for Photoshop** that will be:
- **Better than Dithertone Pro** (more algorithms, faster, smarter)
- **Designed with your design expertise** (your competitive advantage)
- **Sold on Adobe Exchange + your own website** (multiple revenue streams)
- **Targeted at designers, artists, game devs, and print studios**

**Why this works for you:**
- ✅ You know design deeply (rare for plugin devs)
- ✅ You're a strong React developer (great for plugin UX)
- ✅ You have full-stack experience (APIs, databases, etc.)
- ✅ There's a clear market (Dithertone Pro exists and sells)
- ✅ You can build an MVP in 2-3 months

## 💼 Business Model: Why Freemium?

```
FREE TIER (14-day trial, then limited)
├── 2 basic algorithms (Floyd-Steinberg, Ordered)
├── 8-bit color only (256 colors max)
├── Preview only (no batch)
├── No export
└── Goal: Let users test & fall in love

PREMIUM ($29.99/month or $199.99/year)
├── ALL 8+ algorithms
├── Full color support (up to 64 colors dithering)
├── Batch processing
├── Advanced export (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP)
├── Color mapping & presets
├── Priority support
└── Goal: $5K-$10K/month with 200-300 paying customers
```

**Why Freemium?**
- Lower barrier to entry (more downloads)
- Network effects (users evangelize)

## 🔥 Key Decision Points

### Decision 1: Architecture
**Choice Made:** React + TypeScript + UXP  
**Why:** You know React, it's modern, scales well

### Decision 2: Monetization
**Choice Made:** Freemium on Adobe Exchange + Direct Sales  
**Why:** Maximizes distribution, captures willing-to-pay users

### Decision 3: Scope
**Choice Made:** Start with core dithering, expand later  
**Why:** Ship MVP fast, learn from users, iterate

### Decision 4: Algorithms
**Choice Made:** Start with Floyd-Steinberg, add your own "Adaptive"  
**Why:** Proven algorithm + proprietary innovation = competitive edge

## 💡 Pro Tips From The Start

1. **Test in Photoshop Often**  
   Don't code for days without testing. Small test cycles catch bugs early.

2. **Document as You Go**  
   Comments, architecture docs, and decision logs save future you time.

3. **Performance Matters From Day 1**  
   Dithering is computationally expensive. Think performance while coding.

4. **User First**  
   You're a designer. Design the UX first, code second.

5. **Push to GitHub Regularly**  
   Multiple commits per day. You'll thank yourself if anything breaks.

6. **Build for Selling**  
   From Phase 0, think "would I pay for this?" Users will too.

## ❓ Before You Start: Questions To Answer

Ask yourself:

1. **Am I ready to commit 10-15 hours per week for 6 months?**
   - This is realistic, not optimistic
   - More hours = faster launch

2. **Do I have Photoshop 2022+ installed?**
   - You need it to test
   - Full Creative Cloud subscription recommended

3. **Do I have a GitHub account?**
   - If not, create one: github.com/signup

4. **Do I understand why this can be successful?**
   - Market exists (Dithertone Pro proves it)
   - You're building something better
   - Your design skills are the advantage

5. **Am I okay with uncertainty?**
   - Plugin dev is new for you
   - You'll hit problems (normal!)
   - Adobe docs + community will help
