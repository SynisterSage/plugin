## ⚡ Quick Reference - What You Need to Install

| Software | Download Link | Why |
|----------|-------|------|
| **UXP Developer Tool** | Via Creative Cloud app | Required for plugin dev |
| **Node.js** | nodejs.org | JavaScript runtime, package manager |
| **Git** | git-scm.com | Version control |
| **VS Code** | code.visualstudio.com | Code editor |
| **Photoshop 2022+** | Already have? | Required for testing |

**All are FREE.** No hidden costs.

## 🎯 Success Looks Like (By End of Week)

✅ You type in Photoshop: Plugins → Development → DitheraAI Pro  
✅ A panel appears  
✅ It says "DitheraAI Pro - Advanced Dithering Plugin"  
✅ No errors in console  
✅ Code is in a Git repository  

**When all 5 are true: Phase 0 = COMPLETE** 🎉

## ❓ FAQ - Before You Start

**Q: Do I need to buy anything?**  
A: No. All software is free. You need Photoshop CC subscription but you probably already have it.

**Q: How long will Phase 0 take?**  
A: 3-4 hours of actual work spread over 1 week (mostly waiting for downloads/installs).

**Q: What if something breaks?**  
A: SETUP.md has troubleshooting. Most issues are simple (restart terminal, clear cache, etc).

**Q: Can I skip any steps?**  
A: No. Every step is necessary. Even the ones that seem redundant.

**Q: When can I start coding?**  
A: Phase 1 starts after Phase 0 is complete. That's when actual algorithm coding begins.

**Q: Is Phase 0 boring?**  
A: Yes. Setup is always boring. But necessary. Once done, coding starts and it's fun.

## 🚦 My Recommendation (What You Asked For)

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Download UXP Developer Tool** - Takes 5 minutes
2. **Create Adobe account** - Takes 5 minutes
3. **Read PHASE_0_CHECKLIST.md** - Takes 10 minutes
4. **Read SETUP.md** - Takes 30 minutes

**Total: 1 hour. Just reading and downloading.**

### This Week
Follow PHASE_0_CHECKLIST.md **exactly as written**, step by step.  
Don't skip, don't improvise, just follow the checklist.

### By End of Week
You'll have a fully working development environment and a "Hello World" plugin that actually runs in Photoshop.

### Next Week  
Read ARCHITECTURE.md, then start Phase 1 (actual coding).

---

## 📞 How to Get Help During Phase 0

### Before You Get Stuck
- Read SETUP.md first
- Check PHASE_0_CHECKLIST.md
- 90% of issues are covered there

### If You Get Stuck
1. Check troubleshooting section in SETUP.md
2. Google the error message + "photoshop UXP plugin"
3. Check Adobe forums: https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/
4. Come back and ask me with specific error

### Questions You Can Ask Me
- "I did Step 5 and got this error: [error text]"
- "I don't understand Step 7, can you clarify?"
- "My npm install is stuck, what do I do?"

I can help debug specific issues much better than general questions.

## 🎯 One More Thing - Mindset

**This is the "boring" part.** Setup, configuration, environment.

But here's the thing: **Pro developers** understand that 80% of the work is setup and infrastructure. The actual algorithm code is only 20%.

So don't skip it. Don't cut corners. Do it right.

Because once this is done, you have:
- A professional dev environment
- Proper version control
- Clean code structure
- Ready to actually build

And THAT'S when it gets fun. 🚀
